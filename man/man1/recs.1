.TH RECS 1 "2026-02-22" "recs 0.1.0" "RecordStream Manual"

.SH NAME
recs \- a toolkit for taming JSON record streams

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B recs
<command> [options] [files...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
RecordStream is a collection of commands for creating, transforming, and outputting JSON records. Records are JSON objects, one per line. Commands are composed using Unix pipes.
.PP
Commands fall into three categories: input commands (from*) that create records, transform commands that reshape them, and output commands (to*) that render them.
