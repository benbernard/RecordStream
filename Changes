4.0.20  2016-02-23 21:28:40 PST
    All changes in the previous two trial releases, plus a bug fix:

    [Bug fixes]
        * collate: recformin aggregator was until now acting like recformax!

4.0.19-TRIAL  2015-12-30 13:58:01 PST - TRIAL DEVELOPMENT RELEASE
    [Bug fixes]
        * xform/annotate: Guard against trailing comments in snippets

    [Tests]
        * Travis CI: Use new container-based infrastructure for continuing support
        * Travis CI: Install a more appropriate and limited set of dependencies

4.0.18-TRIAL  2015-11-28 15:46:45 PST - TRIAL DEVELOPMENT RELEASE
    [Prereqs]
        * Avoid known-bad Cpanel::JSON::XS versions

    [Documentation]
        * Document the release process in devel/README.md

    [Tests]
        * Report diagnostics on module versions during automated smoke testing

4.0.17  2015-11-20 18:29:48 PST
    [Bug fixes]
        * fromcsv: Properly handle --header when reading multiple files with
          different header lines.  Previously, headers from each file
          accumulated in order, causing the fields of earlier files to be used
          for later files.  This was not noticeable when each file shared the
          same header.

    [Documention]
        * s/PERL/Perl/g in various ancient places
        * Add Thomas Sibley to the authors

    [Features]

        * sort: force a stable sort, always
        * join: composite key support
        * toprettyprint: optionally align values

    [Documentation]
        * Corrected spelling and typos

4.0.14  2015-04-19 21:14:29 PDT
    [Features]
        * Look for site classes to load in ~/.recs/site/ and any path provided
          by RECS_SITELIB
        * Report loaded sites in `recs --version`

    [Bug fixes]
        * Rewrite shebang lines of scripts when installing to ensure the
          correct, install-time Perl is used regardless of environment
        * Site-provided operations are now listed under `recs --list-commands`

    [Tests]
        * Skip all fromdb tests when DBD::SQLite isn't available
        * New tests for App::RecordStream::Site

4.0.13  2015-03-17 21:02:40 PDT
    [Bug fixes]
        * fromjsonarray package now returns a true value

    [Development]
        * RECS_TRACE=1 now makes recs print debugging information about
          command loading
        * Include a CPAN version badge for Github
