Usage: recs-generate <args> <command> [<files>]
   __FORMAT_TEXT__
   Executes <command> for each record to generate a record stream, which is
   then output with a chain link back to the original record.

   <command> is executed opened as a command for each record of input (or
   records from <files>) with \$r set to a App::RecordStream::Record object. The output
   lines of each command execution are interpreted as a serialized Recs records,
   one per line. Each such line is reconstituted as a App::RecordStream::Record, and the
   '_chain' key is added to the record before it is printed. The value of the
   '_chain' key is the record that was originally passed to the eval expression.
   __FORMAT_TEXT__

   For instance.  If you did:
   recs-generate "recs-fromatomfeed http://...?key=\$r->{title}..."

   with input that looked like:
   { 'title' : 'foo' }
   { 'title' : 'bar' }

   then recs-generate would end up executing:
   recs-fromatomfeed http://...?key=foo...

   __FORMAT_TEXT__
   and interpreting the result as a series of new line separated records.

   If the result from recs-fromatomfeed was something like:
   __FORMAT_TEXT__
   { 'title' : 'zip' }
   { 'title' : 'zap' }

   __FORMAT_TEXT__
   then recs-generate would add the chain link so the output would look like:
   __FORMAT_TEXT__
   { 'title' : 'zip', 'chain' : { 'title' : 'foo' } }
   { 'title' : 'zap', 'chain' : { 'title' : 'foo' } }

Arguments:
$args_string

Examples:
   Chain recs from a feed to recs from a second feed and the print the titles.
      recs-fromatomfeed "http://..." | recs-generate "recs-fromatomfeed http://...?key=\$r->{title}" | recs-eval 'join("\t", \$r->{title}, \$r->{chain}->{title})'
