Usage: recs-chain <command> | <command> | ...
   __FORMAT_TEXT__
   Creates an in-memory chain of recs operations.  This avoid serialization and
   deserialization of records at each step in a complex recs pipeline.  For
   ease of use the chain of recs commands main contain non-recs command,
   anything that does not start with a recs- is interpreted as a shell command.
   That command is forked off to the shell.  In this case, serialization and
   deserialization costs apply, but only to and from the shell command,
   everything else is done in memory.  If you have many shell commands in a
   row, there is extra over head, you should instead consider splitting those
   into separate pipes.  See the examples for more information on this.

   Arugments are specified in on the command line separated by pipes.  For most
   shells, you will need to escape the pipe character to avoid having the shell
   interpret the pipe as a shell pipe.

$args_string

Examples:
   Parse some fields, sort and collate, all in memory
      recs-chain recs-frommultire 'data,time=(\\S+) (\\S+)' \\| recs-sort --key time=n \\| recs-collate --a perc,90,data
   Use shell commands in your recs stream
      recs-chain recs-frommultire 'data,time=(\\S+) (\\S+)' \\| recs-sort --key time=n \\| grep foo \\| recs-collate --a perc,90,data
   Many shell commands should be split into real pipes
      recs-chain recs-frommultire 'data,time=(\\S+) (\\S+)' \\| recs-xform '\$r->{now} = time();' \
        | grep foo | sort | uniq | recs-chain recs-collate --a perc,90,data \\| recs-totable
