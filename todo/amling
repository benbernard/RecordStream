filename in input records
    right now we can jam filename on output records as they go out, what about faking it on input records as they come in?
timestamp on input/output records
fix die w/in getopt
--incr collate by time and by record count (--incr is by record count 1)
    maybe even windowed incremental?
        this would be expensive without allowing aggregators to remove points...
        some aggregators are vaguely order dependent (last) so what removal even means for them is unclear
        maybe we promised we'll only remove from the back?
    threshold start for increment as well (start after 10 records, start after 10 seconds)
omfg, hierarchy stuff...
field group
    for e.g.  recs-collate --default-agg sum=tp*
moving average aggregators
    need a field and some need a "time" field
refactor keys nightmare once and for all, this will include domain language keys (and help on them!)
