more aggregators
   linreg
   weighted percentile [map] (may be difficult to decide integration with the domain language...)
recs-frommultire
   block mechanism
      could be sed-esque script where there are primitives for shoving matched groups "into" a block in construction
         could actually be a full perl domain language
recs-join - Join in sqlite for larger db streams
recs-sort, recs-todb - need value options for keyspec groups
recs-fromhtmltable - parse an html file, extract data from a table
recs-collate - use Getopt::Long's multiple option values supports to provide easier aggregators, e.g.  something like --sum x
recs-collate - use fastcollate when possible
recs-tognuplot - use a library rather than invoking gnuplot directly
recs-togchart - use google chart api, seems simplier than gnuplot, could support more options? also look at 'Chart' on CPAN, maybe that instead?, could also support graph viz charts, see: http://code.google.com/apis/chart/image/docs/gallery/graphviz.html
recs-xform - add option to send null $r at the end of the stream to allow final actions after spooling records
--help - have --help fit on one screen for all scripts, (maybe 40 lines), with additionall help available through drifferent help types
Executor - add executor::options_help to all scripts that need it.
tonguplot - scrap and start over?
Options help - remove --filename-key from certain scripts (tognuplot, tohtml, etc)
recs-streamparse - Terrible name... provide state machine line in frommultire but operating on records  see STREAMPARSE_EXAMPLE below for a usecase...
SQL equivalents (recs-grep for Select..WHERE, recs-collate for SELECT AGG() from... GROUP BY KEY) - not sure this is a great idea
recs-sort - allow/demand/offer/whatever stable sort
recs-decollate - flatten (do what flatten does, only for every field flatten would make, make a record instead, ala unhash)

recs-autojoin - join stream against itself

Key groups:
  rerun field group for each record - may have an issue with recs-collate
  'Value attribute' ideas:
      !REGEX!v=numeric
      '!perc-(\d+)!v=Percentile: $1'
      '!perc-!v-eval=Percentile {{field}}'
  "Pretty-ify field names for toptable"
